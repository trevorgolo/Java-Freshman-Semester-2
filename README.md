# Java-Freshman-Semester-2
These are Java programs I wrote during my second semester as a freshman at Marist College!

To run a program, you must first have a Java interpreter installed. To write these programs, I used Eclipse.
To import the programs into Eclipse, 
1. Download the file from GitHub.
2. Open Eclipse
3. Navegate to File > Import...
4. Expand General and select Existing Projects into Workspace. Then click Next.
5. Check the Select Archive File radio button, and browse for where you downloaded the file, and click Open.
6. Esnure that the checkbox next to the file name in the Projects box is checked.
7. Click Finish.
8. The project will now be in your Project Explorer Workspace.

To run the programs, ensure you followed the previous steps. Then,
1. In the Project Explorer Workspace, expand the project you would like to run.
2. Expand the src file.
3. Expand the (default package) file.
4. Double-click the Java program you would like to run.
5. Once it loads, click the green circle with a white arrow in the center to run it. This is located just below the menu bar.
